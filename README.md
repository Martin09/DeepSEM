# DeepSEM
A deep neural net approach to nanostructure analysis in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.

## Introduction
Machine learning and neural network techniques offer exciting new possibilities in all fields of science and engineering. Some recent examples include detecting monolayer materials [[REF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41699-020-0137-z)] Though adoption is slow due to the steep learning curve which results in a higher barrier to entry for people outside of computer science domains.

During my PhD at the [Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials (LMSC)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lmsc/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en), one of the most tedious and time-consuming task was the analysis of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. This analysis was a necessary evil in order to obtain quantitative and comparable data to improve the growth of our nanostructures. 

For my post-doc at LMSC, following my PhD, (catalyzed by COVID-19) I looked at answering the question: **How can we use neural networks to extract unbiased, quantiative information from SEM images in a scalable way?** 

This repository is my attempt to share what I have learned through easy-to-use tutorials and Google Colab scripts. My hope is that these codes will be helpful to other researchers looking to apply cutting-edge machine learning techniques in their own workflows.
