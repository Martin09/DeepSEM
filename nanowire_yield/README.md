# Nanowire Yield Analysis
![NW Yield Summary](../readme_imgs/nw_yield_general.png "NW Yield Summary")

## Goal
The goal of this application was to calculate nanowire (NW) growth yield using deep neural nets optimized for object detection. NWs are grown using [molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular-beam_epitaxy) on a patterned substrate. The NWs are grown in specific positions in a grid-like pattern however, in general, each growth position does not always yield a NW with 100% certainty. Therefore, it is important to characterize what the yield of a particular growth is so that we can modify the growth/substrate preparation conditions to maximize yield.
