# Nanowire Yield Analysis
![NW Yield Summary](../readme_imgs/nw_yield_general.png "NW Yield Summary")

## Goal
The goal of this application was to calculate nanowire (NW) growth yield using deep neural nets optimized for object detection. NWs are grown using [molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular-beam_epitaxy) on a patterned substrate. The NWs are grown in specific positions in a grid-like pattern however, in general, each growth position does not always yield a NW with 100% certainty. Therefore, it is important to characterize what the yield was in a particular growth so that we can modify the growth conditions/substrate preparation to maximize yield in subsequent growths.

## Colab Notebooks
There are three Jupyter notebooks in this application, each one representing an incremental step in achieving the final goal. These have been designed to run inside of a Google Colab instance for its ease of use, cross-platform compatiblity and access to GPUs for training. Here are the direct links to the Colab notebooks:
